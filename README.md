# PANCorpus

This little Python script allows to construct a PAN authorship verification (AV) corpus object, which can be used by AV methods to process authorship verification cases. 

The structure of the folders and the naming convention of the documents must correspond to that of the known PAN AV competitions (2013-2015), which can be looked at:

Existing corpora that follow this format are for instance: 

* **Enron Authorship Verification Corpus**, available under: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/n77w7mygwg/2 

* **Italian Datasets for Authorship Verification**, available under: https://github.com/garuggiero/Italian-Datasets-for-AV

* **Webis-de - NAACL 2019 corpus**, available at: https://github.com/webis-de/NAACL-19
