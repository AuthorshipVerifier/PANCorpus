# PANCorpus

This little tool allows to construct a PAN authorship verification (AV) corpus object, which can be used by AV methods to process verification cases.

The structure of the folders and the naming convention of the documents must correspond to that of the known PAN AV records (2013-2015) that can be looked at:
